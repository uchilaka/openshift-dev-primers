# Getting Started (FAST!) with OpenShift

This guide will be completed with the **OpenShift Trial** available at <a href="https://manage.openshift.com/accounts/auth/keycloak" target="_blank">https://www.openshift.com/trial/</a>. Our link here directs you right to the signup screen for a developer trial - if you visit the link directly, be sure to select the _developer_ track.

Complete the following steps to get going with an OpenShift trial account:

1. **Create a Red Hat account.** You can also login with your Google account (which is what I did). You will be directed to:
   - Provide a username - this defaults to your email address if you login with your Google account
   - Provide a password (keep track of this password - you'll need it for the steps in [the getting started guide](https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/getting-started/))
   - Agree to the disclosures
     You will end up at an account dashboard letting you know that your environment is _queued for provisioning_. No worries - you've got a Red Hat account, so your job is done here for now. Head back to <a href="https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/getting-started/" target="_blank">the getting started guide</a>.
2. Enter the username and password from above in the [Katakoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) Command Line Interface to the right
